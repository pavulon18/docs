#### The Coin

AmityCoin is private, untraceable and unlinkable giving all the more reasons to use it. With a blockchain that cannot be analyzed,
users can feel safe when spending AmityCoin as nobody can see how much was spent nor where it is going. Using a Payment ID when paying
somebody, the recipient can verify that it came from you and nobody else. AmityCoin cannot be hacked, forged or altered for greedy needs as it works upon itself to change its way of thinking to stop attacks from happening. The only way is to be from future.  Are you from the future?

#### The Technology

AmityCoin has a few features to its technology as well as being private. With the CryptoNightV7 algorithm, this makes ASIC machines
obsolete to AmityCoin so they cannot take over the network hashing rate to "steal all the coins" as the hashing algorithm won't let it. 
It also implements LWMA-2 which makes sure block times stick to 90 seconds. We also have added security with privaye keys for your 
wallet allowing you to transport it to an online Web Wallet AmityCoin provides.

#### The Business Plan

The long-term goal for AmityCoin is to be globally accepted, as much as FIAT is, so you could use it to spend in near enough 
any shop you come across. Over the next few years we will hire teams in different countries and cities to try and get AmityCoin
accepted in to their shops. Once we have established a connection with the smaller businesses, we will proress to try and 
get larger businesses on board to see the benefits of AmityCoin.

#### The Future

The promise of a decentralized way of making payments is possible but only with a team and community that is will to do something 
to make that happen. We believe being decentralized will solve some of the worlds problems but also create some probles.  Some people still believe banks are safe and are the way forward, never properly knowing what life is like without one.

#### Community Projects

Once we have fully established ourselves, AmityCoin will set up a fund rasing scheme for its members. This will consist of users
uploading a link to their own developed software, music, art or anything else in a chance to earn some considerable donations from
AmityCoin and its team. This give users opportunities that would have otherwise been impossible to achieve with the use of money.
